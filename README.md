## MLOps workshop with Amazon SageMaker


## Introduction

The Machine Learning process is an iterative process that consists of several steps:

- Identifying a business problem and the related Machine Learning problem
- Data ingestion, integration and preparation
- Data visualization and analysis, feature engineering, model training and model evaluation
- Model deployment, model monitoring and debugging

The previous steps are generally repeated multiple times to better meet business goals following to changes in the source data, decrease in the perfomance of the model, etc.

## Modules

This workshops consists of six modules:

- [**Module 01**](labs/01_configure_sagemaker_studio/): Configure Amazon SageMaker Studio and serverless Jupyter notebooks.
- [**Module 02**](labs/02_initial_notebook/): Initial Notebook - TODO - Add more details.
- [**Module 03**](labs/03_manual_sagemaker_process_train/): Manual SageMaker process training - TODO - Add more details.
- [**Module 04**](labs/04_workflow_sm_pipelines/): SageMaker Pipelines - TODO - Add more details.


You must comply with the order of modules, since the outputs of a module are inputs of the following one.

## Getting started

This workshop has been designed assuming that each participant is using an AWS account that has been provided and pre-configured by the workshop instructor(s).
